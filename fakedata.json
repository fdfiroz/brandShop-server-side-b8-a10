There’s a large, sculpted fuel tank that takes center stage, and the flat, wide handlebars give the New Gixxer a butch stance. The New Gixxer’s sharp look is also thanks to the LED headlight and tail-lamp that Suzuki is offering. Turn indicators continue to be conventional bulbs. Instrumentation is a fully digital affair with read-outs like two trip meters and real-time fuel efficiency being shown. Single-channel ABS ensures safety when panic braking. ",
